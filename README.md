# Credit-Card-Fraud-Transaction-Detection

The goal of the project was to Identify fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 

This project implemented various Machine Learning algorithms (XGBoost, AdaboostClassifier, CatboostClassifier, RandomForestClassifer, PCA, Keras ). 

The problem was binary classification in which we used advanced data exploration, visualization as well as feature engineering.
